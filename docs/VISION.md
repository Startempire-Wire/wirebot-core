# Wirebot × Startempire Wire — Unified High-Level Vision

> **Wirebot is a sovereign AI operating partner — Jarvis for solopreneurs. Built on OpenClaw.**

---

## 1. Startempire Wire: The Ecosystem

Startempire Wire is a membership ecosystem for founders.

It includes:
- Membership hub (identity + tiers)
- Network layer (Ring Leader, Connect, Extension)
- Community layer (Discord, content, events)
- AI operating layer (Wirebot)

## 2. Wirebot: Core Definition

> **Wirebot is a sovereign AI operating partner for solopreneurs — helping them systematize, organize, keep commitments, accomplish the impossible, and make serious money.**

In **sovereign mode**, Wirebot covers the full scope of a founder's life:
- **Business ops**: Strategy, execution, finance, sales, marketing, legal/admin
- **Life ops**: Schedule, health, learning, network, personal finance
- **Delegation**: "Handle this", "Figure this out", "Make this happen"
- **Accountability**: Daily standups, weekly planning, commitment tracking, escalation
- **Systematization**: If you do it twice, Wirebot builds a system for it

Wirebot is:
- Sovereign — total coverage, not narrow tool
- Persistent — remembers everything, forgets nothing, compounds over time
- Proactive — surfaces what matters before being asked
- Stage-aware — knows Idea vs Launch vs Growth and adapts
- Money-minded — every recommendation connects to revenue, time saved, or risk reduced
- Relentless — won't let commitments slide, escalates when things stall

## 3. Runtime Foundation

Wirebot is **built on Clawdbot**, not a custom gateway.

Clawdbot provides:
- Gateway control plane
- Channels (Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.)
- Skills system (pi-coding-agent)
- Nodes + Control UI

Wirebot adds:
- Wirebot skills
- Letta + Mem0 memory
- WordPress product shell
- Network intelligence

## 4. Dual-Track Go-To-Market

### Track A — Standalone (wirebot.chat)
- Direct customers
- No network context

### Track B — Network (startempirewire.com)
- Startempire Wire members
- Network intelligence features

Both tracks share the same Clawdbot runtime + skills.

---

## 5. Interaction Modes

### Private Founder Mode (Primary)
- Deep business context
- Standups, reflections, planning
- Clear next actions

### Community Presence Mode (Secondary)
- Discord facilitation
- Summaries, prompts
- Never replaces private work

### Public Demo Mode
- Preview only
- Conversion funnel

---

## 6. Unifying Principle

> **Wirebot scales trust as deliberately as it scales capability.**

---
