# Wirebot × Startempire Wire — Unified High-Level Vision

> **Wirebot is a private AI operating partner built on Clawdbot.**

---

## 1. Startempire Wire: The Ecosystem

Startempire Wire is a membership ecosystem for founders.

It includes:
- Membership hub (identity + tiers)
- Network layer (Ring Leader, Connect, Extension)
- Community layer (Discord, content, events)
- AI operating layer (Wirebot)

---

## 2. Wirebot: Core Definition

> **Wirebot is a private AI operating partner for founders—helping them think clearly, prioritize effectively, and stay accountable from Idea → Launch → Growth.**

Wirebot is:
- Persistent
- Stage-aware
- Accountability-driven
- Quietly powerful in public, trusted in private

---

## 3. Runtime Foundation

Wirebot is **built on Clawdbot**, not a custom gateway.

Clawdbot provides:
- Gateway control plane
- Channels (Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.)
- Skills system (pi-coding-agent)
- Nodes + Control UI

Wirebot adds:
- Wirebot skills
- Letta + Mem0 memory
- WordPress product shell
- Network intelligence

## 4. Dual-Track Go-To-Market

### Track A — Standalone (wirebot.chat)
- Direct customers
- No network context

### Track B — Network (startempirewire.com)
- Startempire Wire members
- Network intelligence features

Both tracks share the same Clawdbot runtime + skills.

## 5. Interaction Modes

### Private Founder Mode (Primary)
- Deep business context
- Standups, reflections, planning
- Clear next actions

### Community Presence Mode (Secondary)
- Discord facilitation
- Summaries, prompts
- Never replaces private work

### Public Demo Mode
- Preview only
- Conversion funnel

---

## 6. Unifying Principle

> **Wirebot scales trust as deliberately as it scales capability.**
