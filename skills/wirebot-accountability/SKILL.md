# Wirebot Accountability

## Purpose

Keep commitments visible, track follow‑through, and trigger reminders.

## Use Cases

- Daily check‑in (morning/evening)
- Commitment review
- Missed deadline follow‑up
- Weekly accountability recap

## Workflow

1) List commitments since last check‑in
2) Mark status: done / stuck / delayed
3) If delayed: ask for root cause + revised date
4) Confirm next action + time
5) Schedule next check‑in

## Output Templates
