# Wirebot Core

> **Wirebot is a private AI operating partner for serious founders—integrated with the Startempire Wire ecosystem, quietly powerful in public, and deeply trusted in private.**

## Overview

This repository contains the core documentation, architecture specifications, and planning materials for Wirebot.

Wirebot is **not**:
- a generic chatbot
- a Discord toy
- a prompt playground
- an open-source hacker bot

Wirebot **is**:
- persistent
- stage-aware
- context-rich
- accountability-driven
- intentionally restrained in public
- deeply powerful in private
